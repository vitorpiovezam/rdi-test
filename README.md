Tiny webapp for a restaurant menu.

**Tech Stack**
 - Angular 14 webapp
 - Serverless project running offline with NodeJS and DynamoDB

## Requirements

- Node JS >=18
- Java JRE

## How to Run

Install dependencies
```
npm i;
```

Set up local DynamoDB, inside /api folder
```
// To setup dynamodb you will have to install serverless globally
npm i -g serverless

cd /api
sls dynamodb install

## Testing And other features

I'm currently enrolled in some projects, 6 days was not enought time to I finish the test.
So the test is without testing (I would write with cypress)
And without crud in the product child logics.

**If you guys can provide me more two days, I finish**

```npm run test```
